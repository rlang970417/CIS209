              4.16 (Triangle-Printing Program) Write a program that prints the following patterns separately,
              one below the other. Use for loops to generate the patterns. 
              All asterisks (*) should be printed by a single printf statement of the form printf("%s", "*"); 
              (this causes the asterisks to print side by side). 
              [Hint: The last two patterns require that each line begin with an appropriate number of blanks.]

              5.9 (Parking Charges) A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three
              hours and an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof over three hours. 
              The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. 
              Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time. Write a program that will 
              calculate and print the parking charges for each of three customers who parked their cars 
              in this garage yesterday. You should enter the hours parked for each customer. 
              Your program should print the results in a tabular format, and should calculate and print 
              the total of yesterday's receipts. The program should use the function calculateCharges to 
              determine the charge for each customer. Your outputs should appear in the following format:
              </p>

              6.36 (Print a String Backward) Write a recursive function stringReverse that takes a character
              array as an argument, prints it back to front and returns nothing. 
              The function should stop processing and return when the terminating null character of the string is encountered.

              7.31 (Calculator Using Function Pointers) Using the techniques you learned in Fig. 7.28, 
              create a text-based, menu-driven program that allows the user to choose whether 
              to add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers. The program should then input two double values 
              from the user, perform the appropriate calculation and display the result. 
              Use an array of function pointers in which each pointer represents a function that returns void and receives two double parameters. The corresponding functions should each display messages indicating which calculation was performed, the values of the parameters and the result of the calculation.

              8.6 (Displaying Strings in Uppercase and Lowercase) Write a program that inputs a line of

              9.8 (Printing Numbers in Various Field Widths) Write a program to test the results of printing the integer 
              value 12345 and the floating-point value 1.2345 in fields of various sizes. What happens when
              the values are printed in fields containing fewer digits than the values?

              10.8 (Using Unions) Create union integer with members char c, short s, int i, and long b.
              Write a program that inputs values of type char, short, int, and long and stores the values
              in union variables of type union integer. Each union variable should be printed as a char,
              a short, an int, and a long. Do the values always print correctly?
