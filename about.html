          <p>
            This site functions as a content portal for topics related to the CIS 209 course at WCCCD. This site targets the student body of the class for the Summer 2021 semester. The course is entirely online via WCCCD Blackboard. The class does not make use of an online homework or testing engine (e.g.: Cengage MindTap, Pearson MyLab). The book for the class is available in both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0133976890/" target="_blank">hard copy</a> and an <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Deitel-C-How-to-Program-Plus-My-Lab-Programming-with-Pearson-e-Text-Access-Card-Package-8th-Edition/PGM265656.html" target="_blank">electronic edition</a>. A free copy of the international edition can be obtained <a href="http://library.lol/main/7783101D0FCDD843AABE072CFBFA3C70" target="_blank">here</a>. Do note that the international version differs in the available exercises at the end of each chapter. If you are making use of the International version, be sure to keep an eye on the assignments page of this site.

             <a href="assignments.html">Assignments</a> are delivered via Blackboard. I will re-post them to this site along with an image of the page from the physical book. This should answer any questions those of you using the international edition may have. Also, be sure to check out the <a href="guides.html">guides</a> section of this site. It provides useful links on setting up the development environment and additional C programming learning resources.
